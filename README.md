gRPC is a RPC Framework supported by Google and the CNCF. 

> It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.

gRPC offers several advantages such as low latency, good performance, (supports streaming approach) and code generation.

You can get more details [here](https://grpc.io/docs/guides).

The initial components are:

1. API Translator Gateway (HTTP - gRPC)
2. gRPC Server with custom operations.
